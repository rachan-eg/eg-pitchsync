[warmly] Getting started is easy. Sign in quickly using your organization's Single Sign-On—one click and you're in. [short pause] Then, enter your secure team code and you're ready to start your mission. No long forms. NO FRICTION. Just direct access to your goals.

[inspired] Each mission is a real-world business challenge. From construction tech to clean energy, teams work through detailed briefs that explain the problem and the opportunity. [confident] This is where you build the foundation of your pitch.

[intense] The action happens in the WAR ROOM. [short pause] Here, you tackle your pitch phase by phase. Each phase asks specific questions to help you think DEEPER. Timing is key: you lose 10 points for every 10 minutes you take! And remember, you only have THREE retries per phase, so make every submission count.

[impressed] You can type your answers or just use your voice. Our speech-to-text system is fast and accurate. [thoughtful] If you get stuck, AI-powered HINTS are there to help—though using them costs 25 points. Every choice matters.

[energetic] Once you submit, our dual-agent AI system gets to work! [short pause] First, a Red Team critic finds any gaps in your pitch. Then, the LEAD PARTNER gives you an official score and clear feedback on how to improve. 

[confident] These aren't generic answers—every evaluation is specific to your pitch. Watch your score update in real-time as you improve your efficiency and depth. EVERY choice matters.

[creative] The final challenge is VISUAL SYNTHESIS. PitchSync's AI takes your entire journey and creates the perfect image prompt. [mischievously] But the creativity doesn't stop there. With direct links to tools like Gemini or ChatGPT, teams create their final pitch visual. 

[amazed] Once your image is ready... bring it back to PitchSync. Our AI vision agent checks how well it matches your story and gives you a FINAL... decisive score. It’s the perfect mix of human creativity and AI analysis.

[excited] To keep things exciting—the Live Leaderboard! [short pause] See how every team is doing in real-time. You can compete for the ELITE SCORE, or try to become a NO-RETRY LEGEND by getting it right the first time.

[curious] Whether you're aiming for an S-Tier rank or leading in STRATEGIC SPEED... every score is visible to help everyone improve. [invitingly] Who will claim the top spot?

[proud] When it’s time to present, PRESENTATION MODE gives you a polished, full-screen view. [long pause] It shows your visuals, your scores, and your summary—perfect for showing your hard work to stakeholders.

[inspired] And when the mission is complete, PitchSync generates a detailed REPORT for every team. [short pause] It captures your scores, feedback from the AI, and your final visual—all in one shareable document. Perfect for post-event reviews or simply keeping a record of your team's journey.
