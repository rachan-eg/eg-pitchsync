(Narrator: Professional, energetic, and clear voice. Use natural pauses.)

Imagine a place where building a startup pitch feels like a high-stakes competition. A place where you sharpen your story in real-time, guided by smart AI and clear performance scores. 

Welcome to PitchSync—the AI-powered incubator designed to help you master your pitch and get aligned with your team.

Getting started is easy. Sign in quickly using your organization's Single Sign-On. One click and you're in. Then, enter your secure team code and you're ready to start your mission. No long forms. No friction. Just direct access to your goals.

Each mission is a real-world business challenge. From construction tech to clean energy, teams work through detailed briefs that explain the problem and the opportunity. This is where you build the foundation of your pitch.

The action happens in the war room. Here, you tackle your pitch phase by phase. Each phase asks specific questions to help you think deeper. Timing is key: you lose 10 points for every 10 minutes you take. And remember, you only have three retries per phase, so make every submission count.

You can type your answers or just use your voice. Our speech-to-text system is fast and accurate. If you get stuck, AI-powered hints are there to help—though using them costs 25 points. Every choice matters.

Once you submit, our dual-agent AI system gets to work. First, a Red Team critic finds any gaps in your pitch. Then, the Lead Partner gives you an official score and clear feedback on how to improve. 

These aren't generic answers—every evaluation is specific to your pitch. Watch your score update in real-time as you improve your efficiency and depth.

The final challenge is Visual Synthesis. PitchSync's AI takes your entire journey and creates the perfect image prompt. You can then use direct links to tools like Gemini or ChatGPT to create your final pitch visual. 

Once your image is ready, bring it back to PitchSync. Our AI vision agent checks how well it matches your story and gives you a final score. It’s the perfect mix of human creativity and AI analysis.

To keep things exciting, the Live Leaderboard shows how every team is doing. You can compete for the Elite Score, or try to become a No-Retry Legend by getting it right the first time.

Whether you're aiming for an S-Tier rank or leading in Strategic Speed, every score is visible to help everyone improve. Who will claim the top spot?

When it’s time to present, Presentation Mode gives you a polished, full-screen view. It shows your visuals, your scores, and your summary—perfect for showing your hard work to judges or stakeholders.

And when the mission is complete, PitchSync generates a detailed report for every team. It captures your scores, feedback from the AI, and your final visual—all in one shareable document. Perfect for post-event reviews, training records, or just keeping a record of your team's journey.
