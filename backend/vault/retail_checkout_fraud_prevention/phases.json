Traditional detection relies on manual monitoring impossible to sustain across numerous stations, missing most fraudulent transactions while occasionally disrupting honest customers creating dissatisfaction. Random intervention creates friction without effective fraud prevention. Loss prevention teams cannot monitor all transactions, focusing on obvious suspicious behavior while sophisticated fraud passes undetected. The financial impact accumulates through significant inventory shrinkage eroding margins, customer dissatisfaction from intervention awkwardness, and limited scaling of self-checkout adoption due to uncontrolled loss, forcing continued staffing of traditional checkouts despite operational cost savings potential.",
