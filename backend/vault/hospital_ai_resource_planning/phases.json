                "ideal_answer": "Hospital resource planners face overwhelming complexity balancing countless constraints—nursing staff availability, specialty skill requirements, patient census fluctuations, regulatory staffing ratios, budget limitations, shift preferences, training schedules, and operational coverage needs. Manual planning consumes days evaluating scenarios and adjusting assignments, yet produces suboptimal schedules missing efficiency opportunities that comprehensive optimization would reveal. Scenario exploration proves impractical when each iteration requires extensive manual calculation and constraint checking. When conditions change—census spikes, staff illness, emergency demands—replanning requires repeating the entire tedious process. This manual burden results in planner burnout from administrative intensity, suboptimal resource utilization from human optimization limits, delayed response to changing needs, and limited strategic planning capacity consumed by operational scheduling tasks.",
