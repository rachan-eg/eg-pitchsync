                "ideal_answer": "Retail teams struggle with inventory decisions based on static historical forecasts that cannot adapt to rapidly changing market conditions. Traditional planning systems miss critical real-time signals\u2014weather patterns affecting seasonal products, local events driving demand spikes, social media trends creating unexpected surges, or competitor promotions shifting customer behavior. Buyers discover stockouts only when customers complain or sales data reveals missed opportunities, while simultaneously holding excess inventory of slow-moving products that tie up capital and eventually require markdowns. This disconnect between actual demand and inventory positioning results in lost revenue from empty shelves, eroded margins from clearance markdowns, and inefficient working capital deployment that constrains growth.",

Stores experience fewer empty shelves during peak demand periods, capturing sales that would otherwise be lost to competitors. Simultaneously, inventory investments become more efficient as excess stock decreases, freeing working capital for more productive deployment. The financial impact manifests through improved sell-through rates, reduced markdown requirements, higher gross margins from full-price sales, and better inventory turns that strengthen cash flow and return on invested capital.",
