Touchscreen interfaces prove nearly impossible with safety gloves, forcing workers to remove protective equipment risking hand injuries or abandoning real-time data entry. Device interaction while performing physical tasks creates safety hazards and productivity disruptions requiring work stoppage. Critical information needs go unmet because accessing applications mid-task is impractical. Documentation happens hours later from memory rather than real-time, reducing accuracy and completeness. The interaction friction results in incomplete project data undermining management visibility, delayed issue reporting allowing problems to escalate, safety risks from removing gloves or distracted device usage, and productivity loss from constant work interruption for administrative tasks requiring traditional interfaces.",
