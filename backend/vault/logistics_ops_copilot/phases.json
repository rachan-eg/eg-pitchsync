Dispatchers and operations managers cannot monitor thousands of simultaneous shipments to identify early warning signals\u2014weather developing along routes, carrier capacity constraints emerging, facility congestion building\u2014that will cause future delays. When exceptions occur, teams manually investigate root causes across disconnected systems, wasting critical time that could be used for intervention.
