Rule-based systems generate overwhelming false positive rates\u2014legitimate transactions flagged as suspicious\u2014requiring investigators to manually review countless alerts while fraudulent activity slips through undetected. Traditional models cannot adapt quickly to evolving fraud schemes, requiring months of manual rule updates while criminals exploit detection gaps. Teams lack the ability to identify subtle patterns across accounts, channels, and transaction types that signal coordinated fraud rings. When systems do flag transactions, explaining the decision rationale to customers and regulators proves difficult with black-box models, creating compliance risk and customer satisfaction problems.",
