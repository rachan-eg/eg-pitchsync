                "ideal_answer": "Municipal administrators face overwhelming barriers creating digital workflows for citizen services and internal processes. Workflow configuration requires technical expertise most municipal staff lack, creating dependence on limited IT resources or expensive consultants. Each new process digitization consumes weeks translating procedures into workflow logic, creating massive backlogs of manual processes awaiting automation. Standardization across departments proves difficult with inconsistent workflow design approaches. When regulations or procedures change, updating workflows requires the same technical effort as initial creation. This complexity results in prolonged reliance on inefficient manual processes, inconsistent citizen service experiences across departments, delayed service improvements from digitization backlogs, and staff frustration from administrative burden that workflow automation could eliminate if creation weren't so time-consuming and technically demanding.",
