Human teams are often bogged down by repetitive 'Level 1' queries like password resets or order status checks, which leads to burnout and prevents agents from handling complex issues. 24/7 coverage is expensive to maintain globally. Our AI support bot eliminates these bottlenecks by instantly resolving repetitive queries, freeing up human agents for high-value interactions and providing consistent, accurate information around the clock without increasing headcount.",
