Compliance officers cannot demonstrate to auditors exactly how patient information, clinical documents, or internal protocols are handled, logged, or retained when processed externally. Even providers claiming no training on customer data lack transparency into intermediate processing, embeddings storage, or jurisdictional exposure. Organizations face regulatory violation risks from unverifiable external processing, audit failures when unable to prove data isolation, legal exposure from cross-border data access laws, and operational paralysis as AI innovation remains blocked despite competitive pressure and workflow efficiency needs.",

Organizations need complete visibility into data flows for regulatory audits, but external platforms provide no observability into model-level processing or infrastructure handling.
