Practice leaders cannot effectively optimize resource allocation across numerous simultaneous engagements\u2014consultant utilization, skill matching, capacity planning\u2014resulting in underutilized talent, overcommitted teams, and project staffing that compromises delivery quality or profitability. Margin erosion occurs invisibly through scope expansion, inefficient work patterns, and resource deployment misalignments that financial reports reveal only after opportunities for correction have passed. Firms lack tools to predict which engagements face delivery risk or margin pressure early enough for effective intervention. This reactive approach results in client dissatisfaction damaging relationships and references, reduced profitability from unmanaged scope and inefficient delivery, consultant burnout from poor capacity management, and competitive disadvantage as rivals deliver more predictably and profitably.",
