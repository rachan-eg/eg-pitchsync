Current quality systems rely on periodic manual sampling that cannot catch subtle process drift\u2014slight temperature variations, pressure inconsistencies, or material degradation that gradually push production out of spec. Quality engineers lack tools to correlate complex interactions across production stages in real-time, meaning problems are identified too late.
