Traditional project management tools track current status but cannot predict future problems\u2014weather impacts compounding with labor shortages, supply chain delays cascading through dependent trades, design changes rippling through schedules. Project managers cannot synthesize complex risk interactions across hundreds of activities, subcontractors, and external factors that signal delays weeks or months before they materialize. Risk identification happens through periodic reviews rather than continuous monitoring, and mitigation occurs too late to prevent impact. This reactive approach results in project delays damaging client relationships and affecting subsequent work, cost overruns eroding margins and reputation, emergency interventions that are expensive and disruptive, and competitive disadvantage as rivals deliver more predictably through superior project intelligence.",
